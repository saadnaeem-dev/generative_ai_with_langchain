This revised edition builds a foundation in agentic AI, LLM fundamentals, LangChain, & LangGraph for developers at all levels. Fully updated to cover the latest in LangChain and production LLM applications, it captures the evolving ecosystem and enterprise deployment landscape. New coverage includes multi-agent architectures, LangGraph interfaces, robust RAG techniques with hybrid search, re-rankers, and advanced fact-checking mechanisms, plus enterprise-grade testing frameworks. It provides coverage of key design patterns behind agentic systems, practical implementations of multi-agent systems for complex tasks. Explore cutting-edge agent strategies such as Tree of Thought, multi-agent orchestration, detailed error handling, and structured output generation. Coverage dedicated to evaluation, testing, and production deployment reflect the maturing LLM application landscape. Design secure, compliant AI systems with built-in production safeguards, responsible development practices, and a perspective on future research directions.The enhanced RAG coverage features techniques like hybrid search, re-rankers, and fact-checking mechanisms.

Whether upgrading existing LLM applications or building new enterprise-scale solutions, by the end of the book, you will have updated knowledge on the practical patterns needed for production success
