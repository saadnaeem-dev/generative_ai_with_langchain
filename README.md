This second edition tackles the biggest challenge facing companies in AI today: moving from prototypes to production. Fully updated to reflect the latest developments in the LangChain ecosystem, it captures how modern AI systems are developed, deployed, and scaled in enterprise environments. This edition places a strong focus on multi-agent architectures, robust LangGraph workflows, and advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines.
You'll explore design patterns for building agentic systems, with practical implementations of multi-agent setups for complex tasks. The book guides you through reasoning techniques such as Tree-of -Thoughts, structured generation, and agent handoffs‚Äîcomplete with error handling examples. Expanded chapters on testing, evaluation, and deployment address the demands of modern LLM applications, showing you how to design secure, compliant AI systems with built-in safeguards and responsible development principles. This edition also expands RAG coverage with guidance on hybrid search, re-ranking, and fact-checking pipelines to enhance output accuracy.
Whether you're extending existing workflows or architecting multi-agent systems from scratch, this book provides the technical depth and practical instruction needed to design LLM applications ready for success in production environments.
